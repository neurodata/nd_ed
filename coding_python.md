# Coding in Python

## Getting started with Python itself

- [Python 3 Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
## The basic stack
### NumPy
- [w3schools NumPy tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_intro.asp)

### SciPy

### Pandas
- [Pandas cheat sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
- [Selecting subsets of data](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c)
- [Pandas exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises)

## Machine learning
### Scikit-learn

## Visualization
### Matplotlib
- [Cheatsheets](https://github.com/matplotlib/cheatsheets)

### Seaborn

## Timing code
- [Overview of a few methods](https://realpython.com/python-timer/)

## Style
### Python naming conventions

### Code formatting
- Black
- Line lengths

### Layout of a package
- [Structuring Your Project](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/)

## Making code fast
### Parallelization
#### [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Docs are very good for getting started
- [Pedigo's blog post](https://bdpedigo.github.io/posts/2020/02/demo-parallel/)
  on Joblib with reproducible random numbers
- [A better post from Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/parallel_random_state.html)
  also on how to use Joblib with randomness in each child process but still have
  the ability to get reproducible results

#### Other ways of doing parallelization

### Optimizing
- Vectorizing in NumPy
- Numba

## Package setup and management
### Sphinx

### Hosting documentation online

### Testing with pytest

### Continuous integration

### Codecoverage

### PyPI

### Conda-forge

## Jupyter notebooks
### Running from the command line

### Running on a remote server

## VS code and Python
### Recommended extensions

[Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) can allow you to code on a computer other than the one you are using. For example, paired with [proxy jump](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-proxyjump-ssh-proxycommand/), you can code on CIS machines from your persoonal laptop.
