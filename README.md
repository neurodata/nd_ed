## About nd_ed
`nd_ed` is short for NeuroData education! This list is a compilation of resources which we 
have found important for doing work with the [NeuroData lab](https://neurodata.io/) at 
Johns Hopkins University. Wherever possible, we are trying to populate this list with 
resources found elsewhere on the internet (i.e. most things on this list were not created
by us, just compiled here).

## Adding to nd_ed
We welcome contributions (please open a [PR](https://github.com/neurodata/nd_ed/compare)). 

## Questions, comments and requests
If there is something you are confused by or would like to make a request (e.g. there is some 
topic you want to learn more about, and the resources here are insufficient) please open an 
[issue](https://github.com/neurodata/nd_ed/issues/new/choose).
